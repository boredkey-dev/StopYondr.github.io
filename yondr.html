              As a student of Walnut Hills High School, and of the Cincinnati
              Public School district, you may reserve your right to speak out,
              protest, and/or petition against school policies without fear of
              punishment. This right may be upheld so long as the regular flow
              of class activity remains uninterrupted, as guaranteed by the
              first amendment of the United States Constitution and by the
              Tinker V. Des Moines SCOTUS decision.

              The Yondr pouch is a blatant sign of
              <span class="yellow">oppression</span>. This pouch, designed to
              restrict a students access to their phones, not only withholds a
              major
              <span class="yellow">lifeline in the event of an emergency</span>
              (especially considering the increased likelihood of school
              emergencies within the United States), but also costs a
              considerable fortune per district that could otherwise be used to
              support the efforts of both the students and staff of the district
              at large. Some students will be 18 next year,
              <span class="yellow">old enough to be drafted</span>, and they
              will have their phones taken away as if they are little children.
